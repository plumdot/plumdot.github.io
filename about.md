Hello, my name is Ralph. <br> 
I've been programming since 2007, and continue to get hooked a bit more every day.

Currently, I design and architect mobile and web apps for General Motors in Detroit, MI.<br>  
Prior to that, I worked as a web designer for Grey NYC. 

I graduated from the College for Creative Studies, an art and design school located in Detroit.<br>
My concentration was animation and digital media.

Besides software devlopment, I also enjoy photography and making things in my studio.

<br>

I tend to read three dozen books a year. <br>
I mostly like to read fiction and software development books. <br>
There are a few personal development and non-fiction peppered in there too.
[Here's my progress on my reading list.]({% post_url 2015-06-16-reading-list %})

If and when I carve out more time for myself, I plan on finishing ideas I have for short animations and short films.
