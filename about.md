Hello, my name is Ralph. <br> 
I'm a software designer currently working for General Motors in Detroit, MI.
Prior to that, I worked as a designer for Grey NYC.

I started web design and front-end development during my time in undergrad.
I started programing in 2006 with ActionScript to get more interactivity in my websites.
Lately, I like to work on Android apps along with front-end stuff.
I continue to get hooked with programming and ux design every day. 

I graduated from the College for Creative Studies, an art and design school located in Detroit.<br>
My concentration was animation and digital media.

Besides software devlopment, I also enjoy photography and making things in my studio.

<br>

I tend to read three dozen books a year. <br>
I mostly like to read fiction and software development books. <br>
There are a few personal development and non-fiction peppered in there too.
[Here's my progress on my reading list.]({% post_url 2015-06-16-reading-list %})

If and when I carve out more time for myself, I plan on finishing ideas I have for short animations and short films.
