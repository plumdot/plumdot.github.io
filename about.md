Hello, my name is Ralph and I'm based in Detroit, MI. <br> 

I started web design and front-end development during my time in undergrad.
I started programming in 2006 with ActionScript to get more interactivity in my websites.
I continue to get hooked with programming and ux design every day. 

I graduated from the College for Creative Studies, an art and design school located in Detroit.<br>
My concentration was animation and digital media.

Some hobbies include photography, cooking, reading, and exercising.<br>
If and when I carve out more time for myself, I plan on finishing ideas I have for short animations and short films.

You can contact me at my gmail address using my full name. You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/plumdot/), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ralphplumley), [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ralphtomio/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ralphplumley).
