Major takeaways:
Chapters 11, 13, seem to be the most applicable. <br>
A lot of engineering and design meetings get lost in deciding what to do. Chapters 11 and 13 address this.

Ch 1 Notes:<br>
-Quantitative test = interest in proving something. e.g. Is this latest version better than the previous one?<br>
-Qualitative = DIY tests to improve what you're building. Enables insights. Informal. Unscientific. Just observing works.
	-All sites have problems.
	-Most serious problems tend to be easy to find.
	-Watching users informs your design intelligence.

Ch 3 Notes:<br>
-Test once a month.<br>
-Big Honkin' Test (near completion of project) vs DIY (continually).

Ch 4 Notes:<br>
-Are you working on the site? Start testing now. Can / should test all - napkin sketches, pencil sketches, wires, prototypes.

Ch 5 Notes: <br>
-Recruit loosely and grade on a curve. Try to find users who reflect your audience, but don't get hung up about it.<br>
-Uncover as many problems as you can fix.<br>
-Three seems to work well:<br>
	-Likely to encounter many of the most significant problems related to the tasks you're testing.<br>
	-Finding three participants is less work than finding more.<br>
	-Important to to multiple rounds; have a low number makes it easier to do so.<br>
	-With only three participants, it's for colleagues to stop by and observe.<br>
-Offer incentives, money. Or use friends and family.

Ch 6 Notes:<br>
-Think of tasks you'd like to watch. Make them into scenarios.<br>
-Don't let user search on the site, or leave the site (to go to google).<br>
-Remember to do a pilot run!

Ch 8 Notes:<br>
-STay neutral through the test.

Ch 9 Notes:<br>
-Make it a spectator sport. Get everyone involved.

Ch 10 Notes:<br>
-Debriefing.<br>
-Take the worst first. <br>
-Focus ruthlessly on only the most serious problems.

Ch 11 Notes:<br>
-When fixing problems, try to do the least you can do. "Make it better for our users right now" works better than "Eliminate the problem".<br>
-If it's a core issue, there's something you can do about it now.<br>
-A piece of duct tape covering a hole in your pants is better than just having a hole in your pants.<br>
-Tweak, don't redesign or take something away.
