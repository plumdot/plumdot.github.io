I'll update my progress with [CoderByte][CoderByte] in this post.
Answers are up on [this github repo][Github/Coderbyte].

<b>6/14/15</b> - finished with 28/30 Easy ones. While analyzing other user's methods, I noticed how 'elementary' my methods are (using arrays to temporary hold my answers instead of just returning the answer, lack of functional javascript, etc.). I'm looking forward to seeing my progress when I attempt the same questions in several months.
